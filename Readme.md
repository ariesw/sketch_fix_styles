# Fix duplicated styles in sketch

## BETA Version

Styles duplicates while copying from different files objects with same styles. Script search for duplicated styles names, change style to first instance, and delete copies of styles. 

Plugin fix only styles names, but don't change real properties (don't synchronize) so all styles with same name should have same properties

Please backup your sketch file before use
